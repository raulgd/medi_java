This is a demo project to show off some of my skills to create an API and use bootstrap with material design to create a modern web application.

The documentation for this project is here: https://doc.jimi.mx/display/MEDI/

This application uses Java 8 and the Glassfish 4.1 application server with a database JDBC connection pool datasource for ORM.

For Java EE 7, it uses EclipseLink as ORM and for the JAX-RS API for REST Services it uses Jersey.

For database it uses MySQL, but because of the JPA 2.0 standard ORM, it can use any RDBMS supported by EclipseLink.

For the web framework it uses Bootstrap with the material design theme from fezvrasta.

For the forms validation it uses the 1000hz bootstrap validator library.

For performant material design animation it uses Velocity.js
